# Low-Cost-Ventilator

So for MAJOR PROJECT submissions we designed and make a prototype of a low-cost portable mechanical ventilator for use in mass casualty cases and resource-poor environments. The ventilator works by compressing a traditional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a rack and pinion mechanism, which eliminates the need for a human operator. The reverse pressure generated by the diaphragm's contraction motion is used by the human lungs to draw in air for breathing. A ventilator uses a contradictory motion to inflate the lungs using a pumping motion.
 The entire system will be driven by Arduino controller to achieve desired results and to assist patients in COVID pandemic and other emergency situations.

Here is the Program Code of that Project.
